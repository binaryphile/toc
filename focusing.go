	// StepIdentify is Step 1: identify the system's constraint.

	// collecting data or no stage is saturated.

	// StepExploit is Step 2: exploit the constraint — don't waste it.
	// A constraint is identified but exploitation is incomplete: the
	// rope/buffer is not yet active, or the drum is starving.
	StepExploit

	// StepSubordinate is Step 3: subordinate everything else.
	// The constraint is identified, the rope is active, and the drum
	// is not starving. Non-constraints defer to the drum's pace.
	StepSubordinate

	// StepElevate is Step 4: elevate the constraint's capacity.
	// The rebalancer is actively moving resources to the constraint
	// (e.g., adding workers to the drum stage).
	StepElevate

	// StepPreventInertia is Step 5: if the constraint has moved,
	// go back to Step 1 — do not allow inertia to become the
	// system's constraint. The old rope must be rebuilt for the
	// new drum.
	//
	// Constraint migration protocol: cancel old [RopeController]
	// context, call [NewRopeController] with the new drum. EWMA
	// state starts fresh — old drum's signals are irrelevant.
	//
	// Migration safety: the new rope controls a prefix of the old
	// chain. If the constraint moved upstream (embed → walk), the
	// new rope limits head → walk WIP, which limits what reaches
	// embed. The old drum's protection is preserved by reduced supply.
	//
	// CAUTION: do not remove workers from the old drum during
	// migration. If embed was elevated (workers added) and then
	// those workers are moved to walk, embed loses capacity and
	// may become the constraint again. Migration simulation
	// (examples/migration-sim) demonstrated this: stealing one
	// worker caused embed queue to spike and throughput to drop.
	// The rebalancer should NOT steal workers from a recently-
	// elevated stage until the new constraint is confirmed stable
	// across multiple intervals.
